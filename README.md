[![Yoe Distro CI](https://github.com/kraj/meta-clang/workflows/Yoe%20Distro%20CI/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/kraj/meta-clang/actions/workflows/yoe.yml?query=workflow%3AYoe+branch%3Amaster)

# meta-clang (C/C++ frontend and LLVM compiler backend)

This layer provides [clang/llvm](http://clang.llvm.org/) as alternative to system
C/C++ compiler for OpenEmbedded/Yocto Project based distributions. This can cohabit
with GNU Compiler and can be used for specific recipes or full system Compiler

# Getting Started

```shell
git clone git://github.com/openembedded/openembedded-core.git
cd openembedded-core
git clone git://github.com/openembedded/bitbake.git
git clone git://github.com/kraj/meta-clang.git

$ . ./oe-init-build-env
```
If using poky ( Yocto project reference Distribution )

```shell
git clone https://git.yoctoproject.org/git/poky
cd poky
git clone git://github.com/kraj/meta-clang.git

$ . ./oe-init-build-env
```

Add meta-clang overlay
```
bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-clang
```

Check `conf/bblayers.conf` to see that meta-clang is added to layer mix e.g.

# Default Compiler

Note that by default gcc will remain the system compiler, however if you wish
clang to be the default compiler then set

```shell
TOOLCHAIN ?= "clang"
```

in `local.conf`, this would now switch default cross-compiler to be clang 
you can select clang per recipe too by writing bbappends for them containing

```shell
TOOLCHAIN = "clang"
```
also look at `conf/nonclangable.conf` for list of recipes which do not yet fully
build with clang

# Default Compiler Runtime

Default is to use GNU runtime `RUNTIME = "gnu"` which consists of libgcc, libstdc++ to provide C/C++
runtime support. However its possible to use LLVM runtime to replace it where
compile-rt, llvm libunwind, and libc++ are used to provide C/C++ runtime, while
GNU runtime works with both GCC and Clang, LLVM runtime is only tested with Clang
compiler, Switching to use LLVM runtime is done via a config metadata knob

```shell
RUNTIME = "llvm"
```

RUNTIME variable influences individual runtime elements and can be set explcitly as well
e.g. `LIBCPLUSPLUS` `COMPILER_RT` and `UNWINDLIB`

Please note that this will still use crt files from GNU compiler always, while llvm now
do provide crt files, they have not been yet intergrated into toolchain

# Default C++ Standard Library Switch

Using RUNTIME bariable will select which C++ runtime is used, however it can be overridden
if needed to by modifying `LIBCPLUSPLUS` variable, usually defaults used by `RUNTIME` is
best fit. e.g. below we select LLVM C++ as default C++ runtime.

```shell
LIBCPLUSPLUS = "--stdlib=libc++"
```

in `local.conf`.
You can select libstdc++ per package too by writing bbappends for them containing

```shell
LIBCPLUSPLUS_toolchain-clang_pn-<recipe> = "--stdlibc=libc++"
```
Defaults are chosen to be GNU for maximum compatibility with existing GNU systems. Its always
good to use single runtime on a system, mixing runtimes can cause complications during
compilation as well as runtime. However, its upto distribution policies to decide which runtime
to use.

# Adding clang in generated SDK toolchain

clang based cross compiler is not included into the generated SDK using `bitbake meta-toolchain` or
`bitbake -cpopulate_sdk <image>` if clang is expected to be part of SDK, add `CLANGSDK = "1"`
in `local.conf`

```shell
CLANGSDK = "1"
```

# Building

Below we build for qemuarm machine as an example

```shell
$ MACHINE=qemuarm bitbake core-image-full-cmdline
```
# Running

```shell
$ runqemu nographic
```

# Limitations

Few components do not build with clang, if you have a component to add to that list
simply add it to `conf/nonclangable.inc` e.g.

```shell
TOOLCHAIN_pn-<recipe> = "gcc"
```

and OE will start using gcc to cross compile that recipe.

if a component does not build with libc++, you can add it to `conf/nonclangable.inc` e.g.

```shell
CXX_remove_pn-<recipe>_toolchain-clang = " -stdlib=libc++ "
```

# compiler-rt failing in do_configure with custom TARGET_VENDOR

If your DISTRO sets own value of TARGET_VENDOR, then it's need to be added in
CLANG_EXTRA_OE_VENDORS, it should be done automatically, but if compiler-rt fails
like bellow, then check the end of work-shared/llvm-project-source-12.0.0-r0/temp/log.do_patch
is should have line like:
NOTE: Adding support following TARGET_VENDOR values: foo in
  /OE/build/oe-core/tmp-glibc/work-shared/llvm-project-source-12.0.0-r0/git/llvm/lib/Support/Triple.cpp and
  /OE/build/oe-core/tmp-glibc/work-shared/llvm-project-source-12.0.0-r0/git/clang/lib/Driver/ToolChains/Gnu.cpp
and check these files if //CLANG_EXTRA_OE_VENDORS* strings were replaced correctly.
Read add_more_target_vendors function in recipes-devtools/clang/llvm-project-source.inc for more details.
