Subject: [PATCH] openmp: Recognise ARMv7ve machine arch

-march in clang when set to armv7ve emits __ARM_ARCH_7VE__ internal
define and not __ARM_ARCH_7A__, hence the condition fails and openmp can
not be compiled, this makes sure that __ARM_ARCH_7VE__ is taken into
consideration as KMP_ARCH_ARMV7 as well
